Division
    Divisions are the basic classifications for each person. For example, a
    school using the Matchmaker program would likely use the following divisions:
        matchmaker> division
        matchmaker/division> No current divisions. Enter new ones:
        matchmaker/division> 9 freshman; 10 sopohmore; 11 junior; 12 senior
    When entering divisions, be sure to put the ID of the division before the
    name itself, and separate each division with a ";"
