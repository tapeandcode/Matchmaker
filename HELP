Division
    Divisions are the basic classifications for each person. For example, a
    school using the Matchmaker program would likely use the following divisions:
        matchmaker> division
        matchmaker/division> No current divisions. Enter new ones:
        matchmaker/division> 9 freshman; 10 sopohmore; 11 junior; 12 senior
    When entering divisions, be sure to put the ID of the division before the
    name itself, and separate each division with a ";"

Input File
    An Input File is a CSV formatted file that is used to import user data in
    bulk. Fields should be seperated by ',' and text should be enclosed in '"'.
    Because the first line of the file is skipped, leave the headers in it.
